href="https://github.com/qudent/qudent.github.io/blob/935968fec7d4e89e7953f460d1c2b1093bf0da6b/_posts/2022-07-25-convex-knowledge.md">here</a>.
The old version is more verbose/philosophical, in this one, I try to
avoid burying the lede and put the definitions first.)</p>
<h2 id="abstract">1. Abstract</h2>
<p>I develop a convex description of a classical or quantum learner’s or
agent’s state of knowledge and environmental state, which would allow
using convex optimization and duality on problems related to optimal
learning or actions if one restricted to finite-dimensional vector
spaces. The physically possible states are described as a convex subset
of an associative, commutative, ordered <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>-algebra. This also allows
solving formal differential equations and power series that describe
e.g. the evolution of a learner’s knowledge over time when it observes a
Poisson process generating experimental data.</p>
<p>The <strong>outline</strong>: In sections 2-5, I develop the concrete
situations of classical, pure quantum, and mixed quantum physics and
obtain structures <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}^\pm_{\mathrm{class}},\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}^\pm_{\mathrm{quant}},\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}^\pm_{\mathrm{decoh}}.\)</span> More
precisely, section 2 defines sets, sections 3-4 structure on that sets,
and section 5 an equivalence relation that makes equivalent “states of
quasiknowledge” equal. Then section 5 mentions the algebraic axioms that
these structures fulfill. The remaining sections discuss
applications.</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> If you want to speed up reading or don’t
know quantum physics, you can skip all mentions of non-classical
situations.</p>
<h2 id="sets-before-modding-out-the-equivalence-relation">2. Sets before
modding out the equivalence relation</h2>
<p>Consider an agent within an environment that could be in a state
<span class="math inline">\(e\in E,\)</span> with some internal memory
state <span class="math inline">\(m\in M.\)</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the classical case, we describe the situation by a probability
matrix <span class="math inline">\((p_{e,m})_{(e,m)\in E\times
M}\in(\mathbb{R}^+)^{E\times M},\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^+\)</span> denotes the set of
<strong>nonnegative</strong> real numbers,</li>
<li>in the quantum case without decoherence, we have a bipartite quantum
state <span class="math inline">\((\psi_{e,m})_{(e,m)\in E\times
M}\in\mathbb{C}^{E\times M},\)</span> and</li>
<li>we model the quantum case with decoherence by adding an additional
subsystem <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> into which the state is
supposed to have decohered, and and consider a pure quantum state <span
class="math inline">\((\psi_{d,e,m})_{(d,e,m)\in D\times E\times
M}\in\mathbb{C}^{D\times E\times M}\)</span> again.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
</ol>
<p>For a fixed <span class="math inline">\(E,\)</span> we denote and
define sets of possible situations (which will turn into our desired
notions of “states of knowledge” after modding out equivalence relation
in section 5):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;^E_{\mathrm{class}}:=\left\{(M,P)\mid
|M|&lt;\infty, P\in(\mathbb{R}^+)^{E\times M}\right\},\)</span></li>
<li><span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;^E_{\mathrm{quant}}:=\left\{(M,\Psi)\mid
|M|&lt;\infty, \Psi\in\mathbb{C}^{E\times M}\right\},\)</span></li>
<li><span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;^E_{\mathrm{decoh}}:=\left\{(D,M,\Psi)\mid
|D|&lt;\infty, |M|&lt;\infty, \Psi\in\mathbb{C}^{D\times E\times
M}\right\}.\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, we do not fix <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> (or limit their sizes beyond
requiring they are finite), but consider them part of the description.
Furthermore, we don’t force the classical probability distributions or
quantum states to be normalized. We leave out the superscript <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and/or the subscript <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{class},\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{quant},\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{decoh}\)</span> if they are
irrelevant.</p>
<p>We define <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;^\pm:=\mathcal{S}&#39;\times\mathcal{S}&#39;\)</span>
(for classical, coherent-quantum, or decohering-quantum states). Denote
a tuple <span
class="math inline">\((S&#39;_1,S&#39;_2)\in\mathcal{S}&#39;^\pm\)</span>
by <span class="math inline">\(S&#39;_1-S&#39;_2\)</span> and interpret
it as a formal difference accordingly.</p>
<p>As discussed in the outline, we spend the next sections defining more
structure on the sets before modding out the right equivalence relation
in section 6.</p>
<h2 id="set-inclusions-injective-maps">3. Set inclusions (injective
maps)</h2>
<p>We define maps that will play the role of inclusion maps after our
equivalence relation (i.e. allow us to consider some sets as subsets of
other sets - will be/stay injections and form nothing but commutative
diagrams when concatenated):</p>
<h3 id="classical-and-pure-quantum-as-mixed-quantum-states">3.1.
Classical and pure quantum as mixed quantum states</h3>
<p>The inclusions are</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span

<span class="math inline">\((M,P)\to(E\times M,
(\delta_{(e,e&#39;)}\delta_{(m,m&#39;)}\sqrt{P_{e,m}})_{(e,m),e&#39;,m&#39;})\)</span>
(in words, treating a classical as a completely decohered state),</li>
<li><span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;_\mathrm{quant}\to\mathcal{S}&#39;_\mathrm{decoh},\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\((M,\Psi)\to(\{0\},

<span class="math inline">\(S&#39;\to S&#39;-0\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="elements-of-e">3.2. Elements of E</h3>
<p>We want to consider <span class="math inline">\(e\in E\)</span> as a
state in which the environment is guaranteed to be in state <span
class="math inline">\(e.\)</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span
class="math inline">\(E\to\mathcal{S}&#39;_\mathrm{class}\)</span>,
<span
class="math inline">\(e\to(\{0\},(\delta_{e&#39;,e})_{(e&#39;,0)\in
E\times \{0\}}))\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>(where <span class="math inline">\(\{0\}\)</span> is an arbitrary
1-element memory space). The situation is completely analogous in the
pure-quantum or mixed-quantum case (in the latter, with a 1-dimensional
decohering space).</p>
<h3 id="real-numbers">3.3. Real numbers</h3>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^+\to
\mathcal{S}&#39;_\mathrm{class}\)</span> maps <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> to an all-<span

space. <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^+\to

class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;_\mathrm{decoh}\)</span> map to an
all-<span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{r}\)</span> matrix with trivial
memory (and decohering) space.</p>
<p>We embed real numbers <span
class="math inline">\(-r&#39;&lt;0\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;^\pm\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(0-r&#39;\)</span>, i.e. as the negation of the
embedding of <span class="math inline">\(r&#39;\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="operations">4. Operations</h2>
<p>We now define some operations on the <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;^\pm.\)</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Addition, <span class="math inline">\(+,\)</span> is to be
interpreted as the environment+agent being in either of the situations
that the summands describe, and defined with direct sums:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;_{\mathrm{class}},\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\((M_1,P_1)+(M_2,P_2):=(M_1\biguplus M_2,
P&#39;),\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(M_1\biguplus
M_2\)</span> denoting the disjoint union of <span
class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> and the elements of <span
class="math inline">\(P&#39;\)</span> composed of the elements of <span
class="math inline">\(P_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(P_2.\)</span></li>
<li>In <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;_{\mathrm{quant}},\)</span> the
definition is equivalent.</li>
<li>In <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;_{\mathrm{decoh}},\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\((D_1,M_1,\Psi_1) + (D_2,M_2,\Psi_2) := (D_1
\biguplus D_2, M_1 \biguplus M_2, \Psi&#39;),\)</span> with the entries
of <span class="math inline">\(\Psi&#39;\)</span> taken from <span
class="math inline">\(\Psi&#39;_1,\Psi&#39;_2\)</span> if <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> belong to the same summand and set to
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> otherwise.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;^\pm,\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\((A-B) + (C-D) := ((A+C) - (B+D))\)</span> as
expected.</p></li>
<li><p>We denote multiplication on the <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;\)</span> by concatenating the
factors and interpret it as the model having access to two pieces of
knowledge independently. That is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;_{\mathrm{class}},\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\((M_1,P_1)(M_2,P_2) := (M_1 \times M_2,
P&#39;)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(P&#39;_{e, (m_1, m_2)}
:= (P_1)_{e, m_1} (P_2)_{e, m_2},\)</span></li>
<li>equivalently in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;_{\mathrm{quant}},\)</span></li>
<li>and in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;_{\mathrm{decoh}},\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\((D_1,M_1,\Psi_1) (D_2,M_2,\Psi_2) := (D_1 \times
D_2, M_1 \times M_2, \Psi&#39;)\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(\Psi&#39;_{(d_1, d_2), e, (m_1, m_2)} :=
(\Psi_1)_{d_1, e, m_1}(\Psi_2)_{d_2, e, m_2}.\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>In the <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;^\pm,\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\((A-B)(C-D) := (AC+BD) -
(AD+BC).\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Remember that when we consider different possible environments,
we denote our sets by <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;^E\)</span> and similar.
Considering a bipartite environment <span class="math inline">\(E\times
C,\)</span> we define a “partial trace” <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tr}_C \colon \mathcal{S}&#39;^{E\times
C}\to \mathcal{S}&#39;^E.\)</span> This works by considering the <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> register, which previously was part of
the environment, as part of the memory: it maps <span
class="math inline">\(M\to M\times C,\)</span> copies the entries of
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span> and (in the decohering case) leaves
<span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> untouched. After modding out an
equivalence relation in section 6, this will look more like the partial
trace - after making some information accessible to the agent, the state
of knowledge becomes equivalent with respect to all transformations that
it can perform on that information.</p>
<p>Of course, on the <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;^\pm,\)</span> the <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tr}_C (A-B):= \mathrm{tr}_C A -
\mathrm{tr}_C B.\)</span></p>
<p>The partial trace will be useful to discuss the interface between
agent and the environment, i.e. discuss the possibility that the agent
makes observations or performs actions that influence the next system
state.</p></li>
<li><p>We define a preorder <span class="math inline">\(S_1 \leq
S_2\)</span> to capture the notion that the agent can trivially
transform a state into another state, as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;_{\mathrm{class}},\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\((M_1,P_2 T) \leq (M_2,P_2)\)</span> for all
transformation matrices on the memory <span class="math inline">\(T \in
{(\mathbb{R}^+)}^{M_1 \times M_2}\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(\Vert T\Vert_1\leq 1.\)</span> The latter is the
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Matrix_norm&amp;oldid=1100495446#Matrix_norms_induced_by_vector_p-norms">1-norm
of <span class="math inline">\(T,\)</span> i.e. the maximal column
sum.</a> This means that starting from any state <span
class="math inline">\(m_2\in M_2,\)</span> the probabilities of
transitioning to a final state must sum to <strong>at most</strong> one;
if it is <span class="math inline">\(&lt;1\)</span> for some column, we
interpret this as the agent giving up with a certain probability. If
<em>all</em> column sums were <span class="math inline">\(1,\)</span>
we’d get a “proper” transition matrix that doesn’t lose probability
mass.</li>
<li>The definition in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;_{\mathrm{quant}}\)</span> is
analogous (with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^+\)</span>
replaced by <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>) except that
our constraint on <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is that <span
class="math inline">\(\Vert T\Vert_2\leq 1,\)</span> using the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Matrix_norm&amp;oldid=1100495446#Matrix_norms_induced_by_vector_p-norms">2-norm
of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span></a>. This means that the
maximal singular value of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is
<span class="math inline">\(\leq 1.\)</span> Analogously to 1.,
<em>all</em> singular values being <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is equivalent to <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> being an isometry, i.e. a “proper”
quantum transition matrix. If some singular values of <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> are <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;1,\)</span> the block-matrix <span
class="math inline">\(\begin{pmatrix}T\\\\ \sqrt{I-T^\dagger
T}\end{pmatrix}\)</span> is an isometry nevertheless; we can imagine the
agent gives up if it lands in the lower block of that matrix and/or
consider <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> to be one <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_operation&amp;oldid=1094787035#Statement_of_the_theorem">Kraus
operator of a quantum channel</a>.</li>
<li>In <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;_{\mathrm{decoh}},\)</span> we
want to consider transitions involving both <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and the memory. So we have <span
class="math inline">\((D_1,M_1, T_D(\Psi_2 T_M)) \leq (D_2, M_2,
\Psi_2),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(T_D(\Psi_2
T_M))\)</span> denotes
<ol type="1">
<li>The application of some <span class="math inline">\(T_M \in
\mathbb{C}^{M_2 \times (M_1 \times D_M)}\)</span> to the memory space of
<span class="math inline">\(\Psi_2,\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(D_M\)</span> is an intermediate decohering space
and <span class="math inline">\(\Vert T_M\Vert_2\leq 1,\)</span></li>
<li>following that, the application of <span
class="math inline">\(T_D\in \mathbb{C}^{D_1\times (D\times
D_M)}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D_M\)</span>, with <span
class="math inline">\(\Vert T_D\Vert_2\leq 1\)</span> as well. So <span
class="math inline">\(T_M\)</span> transforms the memory and generates a
register <span class="math inline">\(D_M\)</span> that becomes part of
the decohering space, and <span class="math inline">\(T_D\)</span> is an
arbitrary transformation of that decohering space, which is <strong>not
necessarily an isometry either</strong>.<a href="#fn2"

<p>On <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{S}&#39;^\pm,\)</span> <span

</ol>
<h2 id="the-equivalence-relation-and-the-algebra">5. The equivalence
relation and the algebra</h2>
<p>Finally, we define an <strong>equivalence relation</strong> on the
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}&#39;^\pm\)</span> by <span
class="math inline">\(X\sim Y\leftrightarrow (X\leq Y \wedge Y\leq
X)\)</span>, and call the equivalence classes the spaces of
<strong>states of knowledge</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> and <strong>states of
quasiknowledge</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}^\pm\)</span>.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>It is tedious but straightforward to check (fingers crossed) that all
our operations behave well with this equivalence relation and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathcal{S}^\pm\)</span>
becomes a <strong>convex subset of an associative, commutative ordered
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>-algebra</strong>.<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The partial trace <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tr}_C\colon\mathcal{S}^{\pm (E\times
C)}\to \mathcal{S}^{\pm E}\)</span> is a <strong>linear map</strong>
that surjectively maps states of knowledge to states of knowledge
(i.e. the image <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tr}_C(\mathcal{S}^{E\times
C})=\mathcal{S}^{E}\)</span>). Conversely, however, the preimage of a
SOK is <em>not</em> necessarily a SOK. <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tr}_C\)</span> is also monotonous in <span
class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that after the equivalence relation, the set inclusion <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\subseteq
\mathcal{S}^{\pm\{0\}}\)</span> defined in 3.3. is actually
<em>surjective</em> for a 1-element <span
class="math inline">\(E=\{0\}\)</span>. So it makes sense to define a
“total trace” <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tr}\colon
\mathcal{S}^{\pm}\to\mathbb{R}\)</span>, which treats the environment
<span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(\{0\}\times E\)</span> and calculates the partial
trace over <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. Interpreting the
result as an element of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R},\)</span>
this returns the <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-norm/squared
<span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-norm of a SOK.</p>
<h2 id="an-agent-interacting-with-its-environmentconvex-optimization">6.
An agent interacting with its environment/convex optimization</h2>
<h3 id="evolution">6.1. Evolution</h3>
<p>Now consider an agent interacting with its environment. So we
introduce some output and input subsystems <span
class="math inline">\(O,\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(I,\)</span> and a “law of nature” <span
class="math inline">\(T\colon\mathcal{S}^{E\times O}\to
\mathcal{S}^{E\times I}\)</span> that evolves the environment influenced
by the agent’s choices, and generating measurement data. The “law of
nature” should be instantiated as some transition matrix <span
class="math inline">\(T&#39;\)</span>, similar to the ones in our order
definition in 4.4.:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}_\mathrm{class},\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(T&#39;\in(\mathbb{R}^+)^{(E\times
I)\times(E\times O)}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Vert
T&#39;\Vert_1\leq 1,\)</span></li>
<li>For <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}_\mathrm{quant},\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(T&#39;\in\mathbb{C}^{(E\times
I)\times(E\times O)}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Vert
T&#39;\Vert_2\leq 1,\)</span></li>
<li>For <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}_\mathrm{decoh},\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(T&#39;\in\mathbb{C}^{(D_T\times E\times
I)\times(E\times O)}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Vert
T&#39;\Vert_2\leq 1,\)</span> i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(T&#39;\)</span> may add some new space <span
class="math inline">\(D_T\)</span> to the decohering space.</li>
</ol>
<p>Starting with a SOK <span class="math inline">\(S\in
\mathcal{S}^{E},\)</span> the states of knowledge attainable by the
agent in one step are then</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\left\{ \mathrm{tr}_I (T(S_O))
\mid\mathrm{tr}_O S_O \leq S, S_O\in \mathcal{S}^{E\times O}
\right\}:\)</span></p>
<p>The agent is able to apply an arbitrary transformation to its
internal state to write something in <span
class="math inline">\(O,\)</span> which corresponds to creating an
arbitrary SOK <span class="math inline">\(S_O\)</span> whose partial
trace is at most <span class="math inline">\(S.\)</span> Then the
transformation corresponds to applying T, and reading of the input is
application of the partial trace.</p>
<h3 id="measurements">6.2. Measurements</h3>
<p>Now suppose that given <span
class="math inline">\(S\in\mathcal{S}^E,\)</span> the agent wants to
calculate a function <span class="math inline">\(f\colon E\to
C.\)</span> As before, it produces some <span
class="math inline">\(S_C\in \mathcal{S}^{E\times C}\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tr}_C S_C \leq S\)</span>. Given this
<span class="math inline">\(S_C,\)</span> the “probability” (in scare
quotes because <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> doesn’t need to be
normalized) of getting output <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> for
input <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tr}((E,C) S_C)\)</span> (with <span
class="math inline">\((E,C)\)</span> interpreted as a member of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}^{E\times C}\)</span> as in 3.2):
Multiplying by <span class="math inline">\((E,C)\)</span> turns all
elements to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> that don’t correspond
to that combination, and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tr}\)</span> calculates the remaining
probability.</p>
<p>We can easily turn this into some output condition, e.g. the
condition that a SOK needs to allow the agent to calculate a function
with a given maximal error probability. What’s more, these are
<strong>convex</strong> conditions because the SOKs are convex and
partial traces are linear. So when we <strong>truncate to a finite
basis, we should be able to use convex optimization and duality</strong>
<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> to find optimal algorithms that

the environment. This is a generalization of <a

<p>TODO: We can also generalize the adversary bound.</p>
<h2 id="formal-power-series-of-knowledge">7. Formal power series of
knowledge</h2>
<p>Together, addition and multiplication allows us to define formal
power series of knowledge (we leave mathematical rigour for a moment, as
we didn’t define infinite sums). For example, suppose our learner
observes the stars with a telescope without making any choices. In an
infinitesimal time <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\to 0,\)</span>
it observes a supernova with probability <span class="math inline">\(r
\Delta t,\)</span> generating experimental data <span
class="math inline">\(A\in \mathcal{S}.\)</span> Otherwise, it observes
nothing. If <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span> is the state of
knowledge over time, we obtain</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(S(t+\Delta t)\to ((1-r \Delta
t)\mathbf{1}+r\Delta t A) S(t).\)</span></p>
<p>This is solved by</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(S(t)=\exp((A-\mathbf{1})rt)
S(0),\)</span></p>
<p>which is to be interpreted as the appropriate formal infinite power
series. In fact, writing</p>
<p><span
class="math inline">\(K(t)=\exp(-rt)\exp(Art)S(0)=\sum^\infty_{k=0}
\frac{\exp(-rt) (rt)^k}{k!} A^k S(0)\)</span></p>
<p>shows that the amount of knowledge obtained follows a Poisson
distribution. Note that these equations contain minus signs, so our
Grothendieck construction was probably helpful.</p>
<p>TODO: Maybe we can also define such a formal power series when the
agent is allowed to make choices - when considering <em>sets of
attainable states of knowledge</em> instead of <em>individual states of
knowledge</em>.</p>
